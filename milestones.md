# Milestones - Aurora

0. Clear all existing frontend code. Let start fresh with the frontend

1. Get the 3 pager site ready. No bells and whistles, just the site with complete documentation, build tools and unit tests integrated. Think of it from more of a project than a product perspective. 
    - Get the backend restified along with documentation and unit tests
    - Get the frontend pages done with unittests and documentation.
    - Test the site for bugs, and push out the site into prod
   
2. SEO and Analytics/Reporting
    - Integrate meta tags, follow proper SEO guidelines and make the 3 page site bot friendly. Document the process
    - Integrate Google Analytics. Ask questions about data, can we get those insights? If not, push custom events from the site to GA. 
    - Think of ways to engage with audience. Comments? Feedback? Share buttons?
   
3. User submissions
    - Form to add all the parameters of a new resource
    - Admin can approve/edit/disapprove the submission
    
**Hold period. See how the site works out. If daily hits go above a threshold, say 5-10k hits a day, we'll move to the next milestones. Not before that.**

4. Monetisation and moving to a better hosting
    - Adsense approval and integration
    - Migrating to Gandi/Digitalocean
    - Cloudflare integration/optimizing the site site for speed

5. User profiling
    - User registeration/login/avatar creation. **Goal**: More user engagement
    - User can _like_ resources, comment on resource pages
    - User can suggest resources through a form, which can go live after admin moderation. Stackoverflow like profile reputation based on individual user contribution
    - Goal is to make the simplest user profiling we can think of. It has been done a million times before, and no one loves to fill forms.
    
6. Interactive maps
    - Static interactive maps (pngs) for each goal state from base to top, just like FCC's syllabus, but for a number of fields in CS. 
    - Not everyone is blessed with a mentor. Can we have a mentor bot or something that can guide a person trying to reach a particular goal state say web developer by providing him/her with personalized guidance based on maps/chatbots/interactive flowchats?.
