# Techstack - Aurora
- The idea is to have a minimum set of features that we can build with utmost quality.
- Focus is on building production ready components with scalability, proper comments, unit tests implemented and documentation.
- Focus is also on reducing the number of technologies involved. Using a proper set of tools instead of putting in everything at our disposal.

### Backend
- Django-MySQL backend with a restful interface [#TODO Write API documentation]
- Write unit tests for the existing code [#TODO search for a testing lib (unittest?)]
- Integrate Travis
- Documentation for project set up. A stet by step manual for cloning and setting up the project locally for anyone who's looking forward to contribute or use it


### Frontend
- Angularjs - Angular Material CSS framework (version 1)
- Commenting about methods and everything that needs to make sense to a reviewer
- Frontend JS unit tests in Chai

### Deploying
- Python Anywhere or Heroku [if heroku, database has to be Postgres]
- Source code on Github
